i start by creating a venv (virtual environment) thats just good practice thats why. with the command python -m venv name

activate it with name\Scripts\activate

install django with pip install django or if there is an requirements.txt make pip install -r requirements.txt to get all packages in/for that projects

to make a requirements.txt just make pip freeze > requirements.txt

maka a django project with django-admin startproject name and django-admin startapp for an app

after making urls,views, and the templates 

we start the server and look it up in the browser with "pyton manage.py runserver

need to default migrate the django things by running "python manage.py migrate"

and for the model we created we need to run "python manage.py makemigrations" and after "python manage.py migrate "   

bc no user is rn created we make a superuser by running "python manage.py createsuperuser".

After creaeting a model and registring in admin.py we can create a Task in the admin-panel in the browser

now we hook up the css/js file
